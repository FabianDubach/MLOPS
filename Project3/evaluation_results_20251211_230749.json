It is just a methodology to develop AI (artificial intelligence) techniques like clustering, pattern recognition, speech recognition and other tasks that would normally require human intelligence.\n\nBut machine learning has been in use for a long time, right?\n\nYes but it is only from 60s that we heard about Machine learning or used it in the technology business.\n\n",

The problem is that the only way to get a computer\u2019s brain to do a task is to write an algorithm, a list of instructions, each one requiring you either to spell out an individual action or to refer to a set of instructions previously written.
