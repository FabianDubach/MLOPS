# MLOPS
Machine learning operations (MLOps) is a set of techniques and best practices at the intersection of Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering. Its goal is to develop ML systems that are reliable, scalable, reproducible, and can be deployed into production with minimal manual overhead.

This course also teaches best practices for training deep neural networks, as well as distributed training (single model on multiple GPUs).
